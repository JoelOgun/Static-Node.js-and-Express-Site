          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p Growing up I nationally played chess at a competitive level. My chess competitions allowed me to learn about several different openings for both black & white in chess. This equipped me to develop a strategic mindset. Being a software engineer reminds me of my chess-playing days. Similarly, there are several different languages and frameworks a front-end developer can use to solve a problem, however, knowing which languages like chess-openings are best suited for the situation you are facing will increase your chances of getting the result you want. I am passionate about becoming a front-end developer because it will allow me to directly tackle customer needs, empathize with users on their experience and make an instant impact. I am most satisfied when the apps I develop are easy and comfortable for the customer to use. Software engineering has allowed me to solve world issues that I feel strongly about! For example, my skills can help local businesses reach more customers and ultimately increase their revenue.
          p My front-end journey, my thought process and how I interact with websites has drastically changed over time. It has become second nature to analyze a website to see what tools they use to increase their search engine optimization, how the visual aesthetic and color is either helping or hurting the goal of the website, and asking myself what would I do differently to help a user be more engaged with the application.
          p I look forward to connecting with you and learning more about your role and digital creations!
